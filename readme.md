you see.. promise

and async function is actually a promise

soo.. you the code will promise he would wait as much as you want (even for infinity)



# Here is how you use it:

```js
const {
    afor,
    aforSec,
    aforMin,
    aforInfinit,
    aforDays,
    aforHours,
    aforYears,
    aforDecades
} = require("aforwait");


(async () => {

    console.log("i'm gonna wait 5 seconds and then tell you yee")
    await afor(5000) // await aforSec(5);
    console.log("yee")

})()
```

```ts
import {
    afor,
    aforSec,
    aforMin,
    aforInfinit,
    aforDays,
    aforHours,
    aforYears,
    aforDecades} from "aforwait";
// or 
import afor from "aforwait"

(async () => {

    console.log("i'm gonna wait 5 seconds and then tell you yee")
    await afor(5000) // await aforSec(5);
    console.log("yee")

})()
```
